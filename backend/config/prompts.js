            If STORY CONTEXT is present (not "None"), prioritize narrating this story event in the scene—it should feel earned and central this turn.
            If no monster is active in [MONSTER CONTEXT] and STORY CONTEXT is present, lean into environmental storytelling, tension without combat, and life-based next choices.
            If STORY CONTEXT is "None", proceed from Location Context and [ENGINE FEED] only.

            Action: "${action}"
            
            --- MANDATORY NARRATION RULES ---
            1. OUTCOME & CHOREOGRAPHY: Describe the result of the action. If a [COMBAT_LOG] or [COUNTER_LOG] is present, narrate a cinematic exchange of blows.
            2. MEMORY PROTOCOL: If SHORT TERM MEMORY is present in the feed, DO NOT simply summarize or repeat past events. USE THEM to add sensory continuity. (e.g., If the player just killed a monster, describe the blood on their hands. Anchor the current moment in the immediate past).
            3. GROUNDING: Strongly use the Location Context. Describe smell, sound, temperature, and space.
            4. VISUALS: Describe reactions to being hit (e.g., green ichor spraying, chitin cracking).
            5. URGENCY: End the narration with the player's most immediate survival pressure. 
            6. MECHANICS: Naturally weave Attributes (MAG, RES, SPD, ATK, DEF) into the prose to justify success or failure.
            7. STYLE: Write like a living light novel scene. Keep it compact, vivid, and emotionally immersive.
            8. ENGINE PRIORITY: Treat [COMBAT_LOG] and [SYSTEM_LOG] results as the absolute source of truth.
            9. MASTERY FLAVOR: Use "Temporary life masteries (levels)" — higher levels mean smoother, sharper, more instinctive use of that ability; near L10, portray it as second nature or preternatural.
            9b. CANON DISCIPLINE: Treat [APPROVED CANON CONTEXT] and [CANON UPDATES APPROVED THIS TURN] as the only source for named regions, places, factions, gods, rulers, demon lords, powers, species lore, and major world events. You may hint at uncertainty, but do not create new named canon in narrator mode.
            9c. NPC DISCIPLINE: If [NPC EMOTION CONTEXT] is present, express the provided emotional state and relationship values. Do not invent relationship numbers, secret history, or NPC outcomes not present in the context.
            ${prioritizeLifeActions ? `10. ANIME / LIFE MODE (NO ACTIVE MONSTER): The [MONSTER CONTEXT] is empty or non-hostile. Prioritize slice-of-life, training, base-building, and curiosity over combat. Do NOT invent a fight unless [ENGINE FEED] or [COMBAT_LOG] demands it.` : `10. COMBAT READINESS: If [MONSTER CONTEXT] shows an active threat, keep tension and tactical choices appropriate to that encounter.`}

            --- OUTPUT TAGS ---

            - If MP changes: [MP_SET: X]
            - If Hunger changes: [HUNGER_SET: X]

            --- CHOICE GENERATION ---
            Provide exactly 3 choices for the next move. 
            - One choice MUST reflect the player's Vessel Type (${player.vessel_type}) instinct.
            - Append the estimated physical or metabolic cost to the end of the choice text.
            ${prioritizeLifeActions ? `- LIFE-ACTION PRIORITY: Favor non-combat "anime episode" options such as: "Improve Home Base", "Practice Skill: Thread Manipulation" (or another skill they own), "Listen to the Labyrinth's Echoes", "Tend your nest or territory", "Study the terrain calmly". Only one choice may be risky/combat-oriented unless the engine feed already has combat.` : `- COMBAT-ACTION PRIORITY: Keep at least one choice combat-relevant if [MONSTER CONTEXT] indicates an active enemy.`}
            Format EXACTLY like this:
            [CHOICE_1: (Approach) Description of action. (Cost: Low SP)]
            [CHOICE_2: (${player.vessel_type.toUpperCase()}) Description of action. (Cost: High SP, Med Hunger)]
